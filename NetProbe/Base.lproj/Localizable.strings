This also largely depends on which tests you run and on which URLs you test. Please read this document carefully to understand more about the risks related to the use of ooniprobe.\n\nBy running ooniprobe, you are participating as a volunteer in this project. This form includes information that you should be aware of and consent to *prior* to running ooniprobe.";
